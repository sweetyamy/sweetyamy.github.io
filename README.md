  <h4>Needs troubleshooting</h3>
  <ul>
   <li style="text-decoration:line-through;">Arrow-up: It disappears when the page goes to the testimonials area. <b>üèÅfixed (2024-01-14)</b></li>
   The problem is that footers also use "position: relative;", so to place arrows in the first layer, you have to put "z-index: -1;" in a relative position in footer.<br>
   <i>
    position: relative;<br>
    z-index: -1;<br><br>
   </i>
   <li>Blocks the size control when you use it on your phone -> change idea (2024-01-15)</li> 
   When a user watches this website on their phone, the design seems awkward if they reduce the size. 
   Therefore, I was not going to allow the user to scale this website using "user-scalable," but then the user can not zoom in on contents with their hands when they want/need. 
   So it was not a good idea for accessibility. 
   I'm thinking about ways for the user to expand the browser, but not allow to reduce it. 
  </ul>
  <h4>Needs to be updated</h3>
  <ul>
